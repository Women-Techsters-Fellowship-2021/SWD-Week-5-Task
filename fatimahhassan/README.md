# Week 5 Task 

Update your TODO.

You've created a web app that allows users to add todo items, edit their items and mark items as done. But the problem is that our app can only be used once, and by one user. This means that every time the app is refreshed, all the data is lost and we can't remember what we were supposed to do. Now it's time to change that.

Here's what needs to be done: 

- update your todo app to version 2.
- every time a user adds an item to their list, save the data to an API somewhere.
- create a login page and a register page
- Brand new users can register with their email and password.
- Already signed-up users can login to their account.
- Each brand new user gets a fresh empty todo list. 
- When any user populates their list, the list is saved.
- After a user logs out of their account they will no longer have access to their list.
- If a user is logged in, they can find their todo list with all the items that they had added before

 

***Requirements:***

- You must use ReactJS (any CSS framework is allowed)
- Your app must have at least 3 pages
- You must use react-router-dom for switching pages.
- You must make useful API calls within your app.
